# Active Directory {-}

## Enumerate machines by SAMBA with crackmapexec {-}

**CrackMapExec** (a.k.a **CME**) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks.

```bash
cme smb 192.168.0.0/24
```

If we have credentials of a user, and this one have admin priviledges on machines, You can use **CrackMapExec** to check those priviledges.
If it's the case, you will see a (Pwn3d!) in the result.

```bash
cme smb 192.168.0.0/24 -u 'user' -p 'password1'
```


## Sniffing traffic for SAMBA Relay with responder {-}

When SAMBA is created, by default SAMBA cert is not signed. That means that by default it's not possible to validate the origin legitimity. 
In this case Attacker can use tools like responder in order to sniff SAMBA communication traffic.

```bash
cd /usr/share/responder
# config file is in Responder.conf
python3 Responder.py -I eth0 -rdw
```

As soon as a connection is launched, you can see the communication. And because the SAMBA is not signed you can then get the **Hash Net-NTLMv2** of the user.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Hash Net-NTLMv2 Sniffing", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ad-hashnetntlmv2.png")
```

What attacker can do with this hash?

1. copy hashes in a file (*hashes*)
1. bruteforce hashes file with john
    ```bash
    john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes
    ```
