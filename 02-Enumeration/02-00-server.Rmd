# (PART) Enumeration {-}

# Server Enumeration {-}

## Ping for Network connectivity {-}

Ping is a simple tool that allows attackers to know if they can connect to a machine. Ping gives some other informations that can be helpfull.

```bash
ping -c 1 <ip>
```

the output looks like following:

```bash
# ouput

PING 0.0.0.0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.034 ms

--- 0.0.0.0 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.034/0.034/0.034/0.000 ms
```

If you see that you have 1 packet transmitted and 1 received, you know that you have an established connection to the server. 
One relevant information that you can have with the **PING** tool is the ttl because this inoformation allows the attacker to 
know the operating system of the server:  

- ttl 64 -> Linux
- ttl 128 -> Windows

Sometimes the number is not exactly 64 or 128 but is near to those numbers. It's because packets are traveling throw other servers 
before accessing the victim server. If it's the case, you can check the trace route with the following command.

```bash
ping -c 1 <ip> -R

```

## fping to enumerate multiple unknown machines {-}

**fping** is a tool that extends the capabilities of ping in order to enumerate multiple machines in a network

```bash
fping -a -g 192.168.1.0/24 2>/dev/null > targets.txt
```

## NMAP for Machine Enumeration {-}

NMAP is a tool that allows attackers to enumerate the victime machine to understand about wich kind of machine type, services, ports etc he will be confronted.

You can check the open ports of the server with the following command:

```bash
nmap -p- --open -T5 -v -n <ip>
```

- The -p- option is to tell nmap to check the all 65535 ports of the server
- --open is the option to tell nmap to return only the ports that are open
- -T{1,2,3,4,5} is the option to adjust timing to aggressive mode (1 lowest and 5 biggest aggressivity)
- -v is for being in a verbose mode (output result as soon as a port is open)
- -n is for telling nmap to not apply dns resolution

you can check the speed of the scan by pressing multiple time the enter key. If you think that the scan is to slow, you can manage the minimum number of packets should
send per second. If you use this option, it's no more necessary to use the **-T{1,2,3,4,5}** option

```bash
nmap -p- -sS --min-rate 5000 --open -vvv -n -Pn <ip> -oG allPorts
```

- The -sS option tells nmap to do a stealth scan with tcp syn port scan
- --min-rate 5000 is for telling nmap to send a minimum of 5000 packets per second
- -vvv is a triple verbose mode to retrieve more information
- -n to not apply dns resolution
- -Pn for treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
- -o{A,X,N,G} is to select the output format A for all formats, X for xml, N for the nmpa format and G for Grepeable format

As soon as the attacker knows the ports used by the server, you can tell nmap to run enumeration scripts to those ports

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p<ports> <ip> -oN targeted
```

- -sC stands for activate the Nmap Scripting Engine. -sC performs a script scan using the default set of scripts (it's the same as --script=default) 
- -sV stands for script of version detection

## Port scanner with bash {-}

```bash
#!/bin/bash

function ctrl_c(){
    echo -e "\n[!] exit..."
    tput cnorm; exit 1
}

# Ctrl+C
trap ctrl_c intrusive

tput civis
for port in $(seq 1 65535); do
    timeout 1 bash -c "echo '' > /dev/tcp/10.10.10.11/$port" 2>/dev/null && echo "[+] Port $port - OPEN" &
done; wait
tput cnorm
```

## Use specific or grouped nmap script for Enumeration {-}

first you need to update de system database in order to syncronize every files at system level in a database. That helps tools like
**locate** to find files in the machine. The files we want to search are the .nse scripts of nmap and look for them categories.

```bash
updatedb
locate .nse | wc -l # to check the number of scripts
locate .nse
locate .nse | xargs grep "categories"
locate .nse | xargs grep "categories" | grep -oP '".*?"'
locate .nse | xargs grep "categories" | grep -oP '".*?"' | sort -u | wc -l
locate .nse | xargs grep "categories" | grep -oP '".*?"' | sort -u
#Output
"auth"
"broadcast"
"brute"
"default"
"discovery"
"dos"
"exploit"
"external"
"fuzzer"
"intrusive"
"malware"
"safe"
"version"
"vuln"
```

You can then run nmap with scripts from specific categories.

```bash
nmap -p445 10.10.10.40 --script "vuln and safe" -oN smbScan
```

## Search for port with udp protocol {-}

Sometimes the standard enumeration that you do with nmap will not give you the entire list of open ports and that can be because
some ports are open by **udp** and not **tcp**.

You can still use **nmap** to check those ports with the `-sU` argument, but you have to know that the scan will take a while so you can check for a small range of ports or for
kown services port number that can help the attacker like the 161 for snmp and the port 69 for tftp. 

- Check small range of ports

    ```bash
    nmap -p 1-1000 --open -T5 -sU -v 10.10.10.10
    ```

- Check for specific port

    ```bash
    nmap -p161 --open -T5 -sU -v 10.10.10.10
    ```

Other tools can help attackers to reach information of services like the snmp one.

### Get snmp community string with onesixtyone {-}

**onesixtyone** is a tool that will make active enumeration of the snmp service by bruteforcing with community strings in order to find the right community string.
But why is it so interesting to get this famous community string? Because as soon as the attacker knows this community string, he can enumerate internal services and
privileges information of the machine. 

```bash
onesixtyone 10.10.10.10

#Output

10.10.10.10 [public]
```

In this case onesixtyone find that the community string used is the public one.
By default, onesixtyone only try the two most common community strings that are public and private. But there is more community strings possibilities and
onesixtyone can use a dictionnary to bruteforce the community strings.

```bash
onesixtyone -c /opt/SecLists/Discovery/SNMP/common-snmp-community_strings.txt 10.10.10.10
```

### Enumerate internal services and processes with snmpwalk {-}

**snmpwalk** is an enumeration tool take advantage of snmp vulnerability as soon as the attacker knows the community string.
The output of snmpwalk is not easy to understand and it's recommended to first install snmp-mibs-downloader.

1. install snmp-mibs-downloader

    ```bash
    sudo apt install snmp-mibs-downloader
    ```

1. comment mibs: in snmp.conf to configure snmp-mibs-downloader in order to be used with snmpwalk

    ```bash
    nano /etc/snmp/snmp.conf

    # mibs:
    ```

You can now run snmpwalk and use the community string find by **onesixtyone** with the `-c` argument.

```bash
snmpwalk -c public -v2c 10.10.10.10
```

### Enumerate internal services and processed with nmap scripts {-}

As you already know **Nmap** have a lot of scripts and some of them are very usefull for enumerating snmp service.

```bash
locate .nse | grep "snmp"
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="nmap snmp scripts", out.width="90%"}
        knitr::include_graphics("images/nmap-snmp-scripts.png")
```

Interesting scripts are the `snmp-processes` or the `snmp-interfaces`.

```bash
nmap --script snmp-processes -p161 -sU 10.10.10.10 -v -oN processesSNMP
nmap --script snmp-interfaces -p161 -sU 10.10.10.10 -v -oN interfaces
```



## IPV6 enumeration {-}

### Ping a machine with it's ipv6 address {-}

```bash
ping -6 -c1 dead:beef::0250:56ff:feb9:dbf3
```

### Enumerate ports with nmap with the ipv6 address {-}

```bash
nmap -sS -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn -6 dead:beef::0250:56ff:feb9:dbf3
```

### Display ipv6 web app on the web browser {-}

In order to display a web app from an ipv6 address you have to put the ipv6 address between brackets: `[dead:beef::250:56ff:feb9:dbf3]`


### Pass from MAC address to IPV6 link local address {-}


When you find a MAC address, it's possible, following a procedure to convert this address to the IPv6 link-local address.

In the following example we will convert the MAC address 11:22:33:44:55:66

1. Convert the first octet (11) from hexadecimal to binary  
    - **11**:22:33:44:55:66  
    - 11 -> 0001 0001  
1. Invert the 7th bit (if it's 0 put 1, if it's 1 put 0)  
    - 0001 00**0**1 -> 0001 00**1**1  
1. Convert the octet back into hexadecimal  
    - 0001 -> 1  
    - 0011 -> 3  
    - **0001 0011 -> 13**  
1. Replace the original first octet with the newly converted one  
    - **11**:22:33:44:55:66 -> **13**:22:33:44:55:66  
1. Add **ff:fe** to the middle of the new MAC address  
    - 13:22:33:**ff:fe**:44:55:66  
1. Add **dead:beef::** to the beginning of the address  
    - **dead:beef::**13:22:33:ff:fe:44:55:66  
1. group everything by 4 hex digits  
    - dead:beef::1322:33ff:fe44:5566

> [!] Note: In some documentation they talk about putting **fe80::** instead of **dead:beef::** but seams to be the same.
